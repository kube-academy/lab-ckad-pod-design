Each problem provides a mechanism to validate your solution.

The validation was designed to follow a test-driven approach.

Here is how it works:

1. When a problem page loads, a validation script will run, and fail (since the problem is not yet solved).  This will cause the "examiner" banner to turn red, indicating failure.

1. Work on the problem, implement your solution.

1. Click on that red banner again when you're ready to validate your implementation of the problem.  There's no harm in doing this multiple times.

1. If the problem is solved correctly and fully, the red banner will turn green, indicating success. At this point, you're ready to go on to the next problem.

Separately, it's also nice to have a script to run checks for all the problems at once.

Run the script `check-core-concepts` to verify all your solutions.

```terminal:execute
command: check-core-concepts
```
